# Connections

## About

Leveraging the parquet files and duckdb it will be interesting to see 
how we might have existing connections between the NSDF Catalog and
the graph files in [the graphs directory](../graphs/README.md).

The first goal will be to simply see if we can make connections between the
exposed schema.org metadata by the providers and the catalog.
