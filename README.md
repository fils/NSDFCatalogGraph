# NSDF Catalog Graph

## About

This repo is exploring approach to connecting the 
[NSDF Catalog](https://github.com/nsdf-fabric/nsdf-catalog) work with KGs formed
from structured data on the web.  In particular, JSON-LD data graphs expressed by
the websites of some of the catalog contributors.  

To explore this, the resources at the [list of catalogs](https://nationalsciencedatafabric.org/catalog3d.html) 
the NSDF site were indexed using the NSF funded [Gleaner](https://github.com/gleanerio/gleaner) software that is 
part of the [GleanerIO work](https://github.com/gleanerio)

This formed a small initial KG that was used to explore connections.
